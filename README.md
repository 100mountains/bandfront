# Bandfront

A WordPress child theme extension for Storefront that transforms WooCommerce into a Bandcamp-like platform for musicians. Bandfront enables bands to sell and distribute digital music with professional audio processing and download management capabilities.

## Features

- **Parent & Child Stylesheet Enqueue:**  
  Loads both parent and child theme stylesheets in the correct order.

- **WooCommerce Product Image Zoom Disabled:**  
  Removes the zoom feature from WooCommerce product images.

- **Breadcrumbs Removed:**  
  Disables default WooCommerce breadcrumbs.

- **Blocked Email Registration:**  
  - Prevents registration for emails listed in `blocked-emails.txt`.

### Setting up blocked emails  
Create a `blocked-emails.txt` file in the theme root with one email address per line.  
The file is listed in `.gitignore`, so it will never be committed to the repository.  
This allows each installation to maintain its own private block list.

- **Custom Styles and Scripts:**  
  - Enqueues custom CSS for downloads UI.
